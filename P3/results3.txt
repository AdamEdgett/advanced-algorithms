With this project, we attempted to solve NP time-complexity problems graph coloring and knapsack with Integer Linear Programming algorithms.

== Problem 2A - Knapsack ==
To solve this problem we essentially converted the knapsack problem into a simple ILP problem
We used a cost constraint to keep the total cost under the cost bound:
    subject to costConstraint: sum{i in 0..n-1} cost[i] * x[i] <= costBound;
We also set an objective of maximizing the total value:
    maximize objective: sum{i in 0..n-1} value[i] * x[i];

Using this constraint and objective, the ILP solver is able to find the optimal solution quickly

== Problem 2A - Results ==
Using the ampl language and the ILP solver, we were able to solve all of the instances of the knapsack problem very quickly
We were able to run the 1024 item knapsack instance and find the optimal solution almost instantly
This is considerably better than the brute force method that would come close to the optimal solution but took very long to complete
It is also better than the greedy algorithm solution that would run quickly but didn't find an optimal solution

== Problem 2B - Coloring ==
In order to solve graph coloring with ILP, we use a conflict reduction scheme which minimizes the number of conflicts across the generated solution.

To begin, we were provided with color.mod that retrieved data from input files to which were we given variables to work with. This file is assumed common knowledge.

Then, we created our minimization constraint:
	minimize objective: sum{i in 0..numNodes-1, j in 0..numNodes-1} conflict[i, j];

This checks the conflict table for EVERY node to EVERY other node and minimizes the number of conflicts between them. Because we need partial solutions we have to set the conflicts as a soft minimization objective compared to a constraint. If we only wanted optimal solutions, we would translate this to a constraint where all conflicts are 0.

Secondly, a requirement of the solution is that only ONE color can be chosen by a node. We sum all of the colors in color[node, 0..numColors] and only one can be selected (=1):
	s.t. assignment {i in 0..numNodes-1}: sum {c in 0..numColors-1} color[i,c] = 1;

Finally, we set a hard constraint on the conflict table so that any time two neighboring nodes have the same color, there must be a conflict present in the conflict table:
	s.t. recordConstraint {(i,j) in edgeList, c in 0..numColors-1}: conflict[i,j] >= color[i,c] * color[j,c];

== Problem 2B - Results ==
# Nodes		#Colors		#Conflicts	#MIP simplex iterations		#branch and bound nodes		Limit

12   		4 		0		47				0				Optimal

96   		7 		0		30088				9515				Optimal

192  		7 		484		1273				2				Time
192  		8 		538		803				0				Time

As the above results indicate, we were able to solve all problems for a best possible solution except for the 192 nodes problem. While it can be argued we hit a time limit in both 48,5 and 96,6 the fact that we hit 2 conflicts (which is a single coloring conflict between nodes) and previous knowledge that this is the best possible answer, we conclude that it is the optimal solution. The time limit was reached while exhausting all other non-feasible solutions. In each of the 192 nodes instances, we see that we hit the time limit of 600 seconds before an optimal solution can be achieved. This is directly due to the large number of nodes in the problem.
