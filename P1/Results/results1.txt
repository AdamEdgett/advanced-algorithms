With this project, we attempted to solve NP time-complexity problems with a brute force algorithm. Because our solutions were brute force and didn't have much intelligence to them, they ran in O(2^n) time. This is obviously extremely slow for larger numbers. To prevent waiting around for years, we ended our algorithms after 10 minutes of runtime and viewed the results at that point. Although we only ran the programs for a fraction of the runtime, they still came close to the actual solutions.
